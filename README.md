# todo-list

Actually, this is not just a todo, I made a post section called articles, so that I comused a free API JSON posts.
I combined css native with a couple of bootstraps points for help me up the front end in this project.

PD: This project is dedicated to my future boss Romain, I hope everything is going to be good hahaha.
